# Chess
 
 Old chess game I made in Java.
 
 Allows for player vs player locally or computer vs AI.

 The AI was implemented using an minimax algroithm combined with a evaluator which takes a board position and outputs a score which helps determine the best move.
 
 Here is a picture of the game play.
