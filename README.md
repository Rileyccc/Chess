# Chess
 
 Old chess game I made in Java.
 
 Allows for player vs player locally or computer vs AI.

 The AI was implemented using an minimax algroithm combined with a evaluator which takes a board position and outputs a score which helps determine the best move.
 
 Here is a picture of the game play.

 The game ends when a checkmate or a stalemate ouccurs and then there is a finish screen which leads back to the menu.

Never quite finished this project! I was going to add anamations and imporve the ai.
